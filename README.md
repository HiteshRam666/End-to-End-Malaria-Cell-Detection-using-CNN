# Malaria🦟-Cell-Detection-using-CNN

**About this project**

This Project is built using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) Transfer Learning model that helps to predict whether the given X-ray image of the cell is Malaria Infected or Healthy!!

Using transfer learning we have achieved 99% accuracy!!!


## There are 2 classes of images in this dataset

Healthy Cell

## About Dataset 
**Content**
The dataset contains 2 folders

- Infected
- Uninfected
  
And a total of 27,558 images.

**Acknowledgements**

This Dataset is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/
And uploaded here, so anybody trying to start working with this dataset can get started immediately, as to download the
dataset from NIH website is quite slow.
